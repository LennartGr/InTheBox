# Bin Packing App
Created as result of a 1,5 day sprint at the Hackathon event hosted by the WBK insitute (KIT).
Advanced in the context of an entrepreneurship project at Polytech Nancy in France.
Added feature: Analysis of the order history to provide the client with a set
of bins that will enable them to pack future orders efficiently, 
assuming the order history is representative in terms of data.
